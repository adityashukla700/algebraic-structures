# Algebraic Structures

## Finite Field
The code in main.rs contains implementation of field defined for its standard operation i.e., addition and multiplication.

The code demonstrates how the operations are done in field. For example, addition/multiplication of elements of same field results into another element of the respective field and how distributive properties work in field.

Basic test cases have also been implemented and can be run using command: **cargo test**.
